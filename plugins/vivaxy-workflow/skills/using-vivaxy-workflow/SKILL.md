# Using vivaxy Workflow

vivaxy Workflow enforces a structured 5-phase development process: main:clarify → main:plan → execute subtasks → main:review → main:deliver.

## When vivaxy Workflow Applies

| Task type | vivaxy Workflow required? |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Implement a new feature | YES — route based on workflow state |
| Add a new API endpoint or route | YES — route based on workflow state |
| Refactor a module's structure | YES — route based on workflow state |
| Add a new component / service | YES — route based on workflow state |
| Fix a bug in existing code | NO |
| Fix a typo or rename | NO |
| Write or update tests | NO |
| Answer a question | NO |
| Update documentation | NO |
| Update a config value | NO |

**Rule**: If the task adds new behavior or changes how modules interact — vivaxy Workflow applies. If it corrects something that was supposed to work already — vivaxy Workflow does not apply.

## Routing Logic

For feature tasks, detect the current workflow state by checking `docs/`:

| Condition | Route to |
|-----------|----------|
| `docs/doc-clarification.md` does not exist | `vivaxy-workflow:main:clarify` |
| `doc-clarification.md` exists, `doc-subtasks.md` does not exist | `vivaxy-workflow:main:plan` |
| `doc-subtasks.md` exists with at least one PENDING subtask | `vivaxy-workflow:subtask-execute <first-pending-id>` |
| All subtasks in `doc-subtasks.md` are ACCEPTED, no retrospective yet | `vivaxy-workflow:main:review` |
| `doc-retrospective-*.md` does not exist after all subtasks accepted | `vivaxy-workflow:main:deliver` |
| Bug fix / non-feature task | Proceed normally |

## How to Route

Do not wait for user confirmation. Immediately:

1. Say one line: "vivaxy Workflow is active — routing to `vivaxy-workflow:<skill>`."
2. Invoke the appropriate skill.

## When vivaxy Workflow Is Not Initialized

If `docs/` does not exist or `doc-clarification.md` is missing, invoke `vivaxy-workflow:main:clarify` directly. It will create `docs/` as needed.

## Instruction Priority

1. User's explicit instructions (CLAUDE.md, direct requests) — highest
2. vivaxy Workflow routing — for feature development tasks
2b. Analyze skill suggestions — for complex, unclear, or high-stakes problems
3. Default behavior — for everything else

If the user says "just implement it, skip the workflow" — respect that.

## Analyze Skills

The analyze skills provide structured problem analysis and visual modeling. They are on-demand tools — invoke them when the user's question would benefit from rigorous decomposition or visual modeling.

### When to Invoke vivaxy-workflow:analyze:problem

Invoke when the user:
- Presents a vague, complex, or multi-layered problem ("why is X happening?", "how should I approach Y?")
- Is reasoning by analogy ("everyone does it this way, should we?") — first-principles thinking would help
- Has a problem with unclear root cause (symptoms are visible but causes are not)
- Needs to frame a problem for a team before deciding what to do
- Is stuck and not sure where to start

Note: `vivaxy-workflow:analyze:problem` writes a `facts.md` file and concludes with **key questions to investigate** — not action recommendations. Most valuable when the problem needs rigorous framing before action.

Do **not** invoke for:
- Simple factual questions with clear answers
- Requests to implement a specific, well-defined task
- Cases where the user has already done the analysis and just needs execution

### When to Invoke vivaxy-workflow:analyze:model

Invoke when the user:
- Wants to understand how a domain, system, or codebase is structured
- Is onboarding to a new area and needs a map
- Needs to communicate a concept visually (to themselves or others)
- Is designing something and wants to see the entities and relationships before writing code

### How to Invoke

Keep it lightweight — one sentence, then invoke immediately:

> "This looks like a good case for a structured analysis — running `vivaxy-workflow:analyze:problem` now."

Then invoke the skill via the `Skill` tool. Never force it.

If the user says "just answer it" or "skip the analysis" — respect that immediately.
