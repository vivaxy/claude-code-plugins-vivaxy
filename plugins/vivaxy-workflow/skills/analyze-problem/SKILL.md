<objective>
Apply a structured analysis to the problem described in `$ARGUMENTS`. Move through three phases — Facts, Model, Key Questions — and produce a `facts.md` file as a persistent, authoritative source of truth that anchors every subsequent reasoning step.

The core principle: **facts first, model second, questions last**. Never state a fact in Steps 3–7 that is not recorded in `facts.md`. Conclusions take the form of key questions to investigate, not action recommendations.
</objective>

<process>

## Step 1: Restate the Problem

Rewrite the problem in one precise sentence. Make the following explicit:
- **Who** is affected
- **What** is actually broken or unclear (symptom vs. problem)
- **Where** (system, context, scope)
- **When** (always, intermittently, since when)
- **What is NOT the problem** (boundary)

If the problem statement is too vague to restate precisely, ask one focused clarifying question and stop. Do not ask multiple questions at once.

## Step 2: Collect Facts → Write `facts.md`

Strip away all analogies, conventions, and inherited thinking. For each claim embedded in the problem statement, ask: *"Do I know this is true, or am I just accepting it?"*

Collect facts into four categories, assigning each an ID (F1, F2, …):

- **Verified facts** (F#) — things directly observable or measurable; cite sources or evidence
- **Challenged assumptions** (A#) — things accepted as true but not yet verified; note what would confirm or refute each
- **Hard constraints** (C#) — physical, logical, or system-level limits that cannot be changed
- **Evidence gaps** (G#) — things we do not know but need to know; these will directly generate Key Questions in Step 7

Then **write all of the above to `.claude/analysis/<slug>/facts.md`** using the Write tool, where `<slug>` is a kebab-case short title derived from the problem (e.g., `api-latency-spike`, `onboarding-drop-off`). Create the directory path if it does not exist. Use this format:

```markdown
# Facts: <short problem title>

## Verified Facts
- F1: <fact> — <source or evidence>
- F2: ...

## Challenged Assumptions
- A1: <assumption> — <what would confirm or refute it>
- A2: ...

## Hard Constraints
- C1: <constraint>
- C2: ...

## Evidence Gaps
- G1: <what we don't know> — <why it matters>
- G2: ...
```

Every subsequent step must reference this file. Do not introduce new facts in Steps 3–7 — if you discover something new, go back and add it to `.claude/analysis/<slug>/facts.md` first.

## Step 3: Decompose

Break the problem into sub-problems that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE). Only decompositions consistent with `facts.md` are valid. For each sub-problem:

```
Sub-problem A: <name>
  What: <description>
  Scope: contained | cross-cutting
  Relevant facts: F#, A#, C#
```

Analyze each sub-problem independently before looking at interactions.

## Step 4: Root Cause Tracing

For each sub-problem, trace causality using up to 5 levels of "Why". Each "Why" must cite a fact ID from `facts.md`, or be explicitly labeled `[assumption]`:

```
Symptom: <observable effect>
Why 1: <immediate cause> [F# or assumption]
Why 2: <cause of that cause> [F# or assumption]
Why 3: ...
Root cause: <underlying reason that, if fixed, prevents the symptom>
```

Distinguish:
- **Symptoms** — visible effects (what you see)
- **Proximate causes** — direct triggers (what caused it)
- **Root causes** — underlying conditions (why it was possible)

## Step 5: Build a Visual Model

Choose the diagram type based on the problem:
- **Causal chain** → `graph LR` (cause → effect flows)
- **Concept breakdown** → `mindmap` (hierarchical decomposition)
- **System with interactions** → `graph TD` (components + relationships)
- **Process / sequence** → `flowchart TD`

Generate the Mermaid diagram. Node labels may reference fact IDs (e.g., `F1`, `G2`) to make the model traceable. Use `<br>` for line breaks inside node labels. Ensure valid syntax.

```mermaid
<diagram here>
```

Add a brief legend explaining what the diagram shows.

## Step 6: Synthesize — Emergent Properties and Tensions

Zoom back out. After analyzing the parts, describe — grounded in `facts.md`:
- **Interactions**: how sub-problems affect each other
- **Emergent properties**: effects that only appear when parts combine
- **Core tension**: the fundamental trade-off or conflict at the heart of this problem

This section should produce a richer understanding than the original problem statement.

## Step 7: Key Questions

Derive 3–7 key questions from the model. Each question must be rooted in a root cause, evidence gap, or challenged assumption identified above. For each:

```
### Q<N>: <question>

**Targets**: which sub-problem / root cause / gap this addresses
**Unlocks**: what becomes possible once this is answered
**Type**: Diagnostic | Decision | Risk
**Priority**: High | Medium  (impact × uncertainty)
```

- **Diagnostic**: clarifies what is actually true
- **Decision**: resolves a choice between options
- **Risk**: surfaces a threat that may need mitigation

Order questions by priority (High first). Do not include recommendations or action plans — the conclusion is what to investigate, not what to do.

<guidelines>
- Never skip Step 2 — writing `.claude/analysis/<slug>/facts.md` is what separates this analysis from a surface-level summary
- Never state a fact in Steps 3–7 that is not in that file; if new facts emerge, add them there first
- Evidence gaps (G#) are first-class outputs — they directly generate Key Questions
- The diagram must be generated even if simple — visual representation forces structural clarity
- If the problem touches code in the current project, use Read/Glob/Grep to gather relevant context before Step 2
- Keep each step focused; avoid repetition across steps
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user to describe the problem they want analyzed
</guidelines>
