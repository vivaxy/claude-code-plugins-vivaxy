## Key Decisions

- The plugin has no runtime server — it is a set of instruction files interpreted by Claude Code
- `docs/` is the authoritative source of truth; code must conform to documents and diagrams, not the reverse
- The plugin operates on the user's project directory, not on its own source

## Notes

- See `flow-execution.md` for the automatic skill invocation workflow
- See `arch-modules.md` for internal plugin component layout
