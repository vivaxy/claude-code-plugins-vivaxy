<objective>
Read the clarified problem from the current conversation context (established by `main:clarify`), analyze the codebase and existing docs, decompose the work into ordered subtasks with acceptance criteria, produce or update design documents and diagrams, get user approval via ExitPlanMode, then output the approved subtask plan as a structured block in the conversation.
</objective>

<process>

## Preamble: Enter Plan Mode

Call `EnterPlanMode` immediately. All exploration and analysis is read-only until ExitPlanMode returns with approval.

## Step 1: Read Clarification

Use the clarification summary from the current conversation context. If no clarification has been established yet, invoke `cadence:main:clarify` first and stop.

Extract:
- Problem statement
- Scope (in/out)
- Constraints
- Success criteria

## Step 2: Read Existing Docs and Codebase

Read all files in `docs/` (excluding `drafts/`):
- `overview.md`
- All `flow-*.md` files
- All `arch-*.md` files

Also scan the project root to understand the current codebase structure (Glob for key files).

Build a mental model of what already exists and what needs to change.

## Step 3: Decompose into Subtasks

Break the feature into ordered, independent-as-possible subtasks. For each subtask define:
- **ID**: `ST-01`, `ST-02`, etc.
- **Title**: imperative phrase (e.g., "Add user authentication endpoint")
- **Description**: what needs to be built
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 2–4 measurable criteria (what must be true for this subtask to be ACCEPTED)
- **Dependencies**: list of subtask IDs that must be ACCEPTED first (empty if none)
- **Scope**: which files/modules are expected to change

Guidelines:
- Each subtask should be completable in one focused session
- Acceptance criteria must be specific and verifiable (e.g., "POST /login returns 200 with JWT token", not "login works")
- Order subtasks so dependencies flow naturally (infrastructure before features, shared utilities before consumers)

## Step 4: Design Document and Diagram Impact Analysis

For each subtask, determine which `docs/` files need to change:
- **No change**: subtask has no architectural impact
- **Minor update**: small addition to an existing file
- **Major update**: new section, new flow path, new module
- **New file needed**: new design area

Produce the full proposed content for each new or modified file.

## Step 5: Call ExitPlanMode with Full Proposal

Compose the proposal and call ExitPlanMode. The plan must include:

```
## Proposed Plan

**Feature**: <one-line summary from clarification>

### Subtasks

| ID | Title | Dependencies |
|----|-------|--------------|
| ST-01 | <title> | — |
| ST-02 | <title> | ST-01 |

---

#### ST-01: <Title>

**Description**: <what to build>

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- <criterion 1>
- <criterion 2>

**Expected scope**: <files/modules>

---

### Document and Diagram Changes

**<filename.md>** (NEW / major update / minor update)
<proposed content or diff description>
```

If the user rejects the plan, incorporate their feedback and call ExitPlanMode again.

## Step 6: Apply Approved Changes

After the user approves (ExitPlanMode returns with approval):

1. Create or update each diagram file in `docs/`
2. Output the approved subtask plan as a structured block in the conversation:

```markdown
# Subtask Plan

> **Type**: Subtask Plan
> **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Feature**: <feature name from clarification>

## Subtasks

### ST-01: <Title>

> **Status**: PENDING
> **Dependencies**: —

**Description**: <description>

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] <criterion 1>
- [ ] <criterion 2>

**Expected scope**: <files/modules>

---

### ST-02: <Title>

> **Status**: PENDING
> **Dependencies**: ST-01

...
```

Output:
```
Plan applied:
- Created/updated: docs/<file>.md
- Subtask plan output to conversation (<N> subtasks: ST-01 through ST-0N)

Run `cadence:subtask-execute ST-01` to begin.
```

</process>

<guidelines>
- Acceptance criteria must be verifiable, not subjective
- If a subtask touches architecture or introduces a new module, always produce or update the relevant `arch-*.md` or `flow-*.md` diagram
- Diagrams must use valid Mermaid syntax; use `<br>` for line breaks in node labels
- Keep subtasks focused — if a subtask would change more than 5 files, consider splitting it
- The subtask plan output to conversation is the single source of truth for subtask status; do not track status anywhere else
</guidelines>
