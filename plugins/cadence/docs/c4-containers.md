  Person(developer, "Developer", "Uses Claude Code to build software features")

  System_Boundary(cadence, "cadence Plugin") {
    Container(hooks, "Hooks", "Bash scripts", "SessionStart hook — injects routing skill into every new session")
    Container(skills, "Skills & Agents", "Markdown instruction files", "using-cadence routing, clarify, plan, review, deliver agents")
    ContainerDb(docs, "docs/", "Markdown + Mermaid", "Authoritative C4 design documents and sequence diagrams")
  }

  System_Ext(projectSrc, "Project Source Code", "The user's application source files")

  Rel(developer, skills, "Describes feature task to", "Claude Code session")
  Rel(hooks, skills, "Injects routing context at session start")
  Rel(skills, docs, "Reads and writes")
  Rel(skills, projectSrc, "Reads and writes")
  Rel(docs, projectSrc, "Constrains")
```

## Key Decisions

- Skills and agents are Markdown instruction files interpreted by Claude at runtime — not executable code
- `docs/` acts as a database container: it persists design state across sessions
- The hooks container has no logic — it only bootstraps the routing skill at session start

## Notes

- See `c4-context.md` for the system boundary view
- See `c4-component-plugin.md` for internal components within the Skills & Agents container
- See `c4-seq-execution.md` for how these containers interact at runtime
